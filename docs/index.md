#### Abstract

A pendulum rotating under vertical base excitation is considered from the viewpoint of energy extrac-
tion. Since the uncontrolled system can exhibit complex dynamics, we consider an added control torque
and seek the optimal period-1 rotational motion for maximum energy extraction. We find, and con-
firm through complementary methods, that the limiting optimal motion for harmonic base excitation is
piecewise-constant: there are extended dwells at the top and bottom positions with rapid transitions
in between. The limiting optimal solution gives about a quarter more energy extraction than uniform
rotation, in the limit of no damping. Approximating motions with finite-speed transitions can be almost
as good. Base excitations other than pure sinusoids are also considered and the corresponding optima
determined.
